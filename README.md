# Hello There!

# Goal
This project was provided by https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges . The goal of this project was to use the assets and design files that frontend mentor gives us
and recreate it as accurate as possible. 

# Tech Stack
I was very excited to go back and give myself a proper start to TailwindCSS. Lately I've been using SCSS/SASS Pre-processor. It's been my go-to way of styling 
webpages and I've grown very accustomed to it. However, I still wanted to get better at a CSS framework and upon discovering Tailwind a few months ago and 
demo-ing it, I grew to really like using the framework. Therefore, I decided to start this simple project using only Tailwind for styling. 

# Results
Using tailwind really changed my design process, for the better of course. Tailwind really focuses on mobile-first development which I realized how important it is
when developing websites. Today, almost all of us visit applications and websites via mobile, so designing and developing a website or page with a mobile-first
approach helps refine the responsiveness. As a result, I grew to prefer the process of mobile > tablet > desktop. Going through the documentation for Tailwind while
finishing this project was a very important and satisfying learning experience. It definitely made me more confident in styling websites with Tailwind. 
This encouraged me to start my new multi-page website(also from FrontEnd Mentor's website) and complete it using Tailwind.
